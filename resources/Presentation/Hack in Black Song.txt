Hack in black
We hit the snacks
Its been too long time to start this hack
We will let loose
the brain juice
That's kept us going
as we code the duces
the keyboard strokes are gettin' us high
get the shades 'cause the sun hurts the eyes
we've got nine more lines
the code is fine
we hit the sync and github is online

'Cause we hack
Yes, we hack
Well, we hack
Yes, we hack
Well, we hack, hack
Well, we hack in black
Yes, we hack in black

We hack in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, its a power pack
Yes, with in a bang
we are a gang
They've got to catch us if they want us to hang
'Cause we're back on the track
And we're beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get us on another rap
So look at us now
Makin'DAM for free
So don't be sorting your graphs, just hit the key

'Cause we hack
Yes, we hack
Well, we hack
Yes, we hack
Well, we hack, hack
Well, we hack in black
Yes, we hack in black

Well, we hack, yes we hack
Well, we hack, yes we hack
Well, we hack, hack
Well, we hack in black
Yes, we hack in black

Ho yeah
Oh yeah
Yes I we are
Oh yeah, yeah oh yeah
Hack it now
Well we hack, we hack
Hack, (we hack)
Hack, (we hack)
Hack, (we hack)
Hack, (we hack)
Hack
Hack in black
Yes yes hack in black
Out of the sight
